### A place to practice lab GitHub stuffs and other things that are cool :octocat:


*Some thoughts on life*

Do we even exist? Sometimes I find myself looking in the mirror and realize that I am a person - a warm-blooded, breathing, live person. It is almost an out of body experience where I have complete self awareness of my being and it can be scary at times. I feel so vulnerable and small. Do I even matter? What is my purpose on Earth? Perhaps I will never know, but at least I have enough to keep me grounded.
